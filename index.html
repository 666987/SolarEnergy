							<p #id="par1">A solar charger gathers energy from your solar panels, and stores it in your batteries. Using the latest, fastest technology, SmartSolar maximises this energy-harvest, driving it intelligently to achieve full charge in the shortest possible time. SmartSolar maintains battery health, extending its life.
								The SmartSolar charge controller will even recharge a severely depleted battery. It can operate with a battery voltage as low as 0 Volts, provided the cells are not permanently sulphated or otherwise damaged.

							<p #id="par2">Solar charge controllers Steca Solarix 2525 and 4040 are newly developed products based on the internationally renowned controller family Steca PR. With increased module and load current, the controllers are now also suitable for even larger systems. The devices also feature an integrated USB charging port for charging smartphones and tablets.
								Use of the latest charging technologies combined with state of charge determination enable optimal battery maintenance and module power monitoring. A large display informs the user about all operating modes with the aid of symbols. The state of charge is represented visually as a level meter. Data such as voltage, current and state of charge can also be displayed digitally as figures on the display. In addition, the controller has an energy meter which can be reset by the user.
