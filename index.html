								<h1>Victron SmartSolar MPPT 100-50 12V 24V charge controller</h1>
								<p class="PFlex">This product is quite nice. You could use it in multiple, you can use it as a frisbee altough I wouldnt do that if I were you tho. The product is meant for collecting solar energy. But as i said you can do
								whatever you want with the product, I really couldnt care less if you wouldn't use it for his purpose. You can even write a song on the solar charger. like i said im just writing this to waste words for my text and the professor said 
								it could be a random text as long as its not lorem ipsum so thats what im doing right now.
